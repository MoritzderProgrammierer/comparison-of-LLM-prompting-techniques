Translation Eng->De: The number of cases of thefts has fallen from 1,232 to 1,088 compared to the same period in 2019, while cases of assault and sexual offenses have increased from 77 to 86.
"It is not an easy job. You have to keep your hand on the pulse of the city," says the police officer, who is responsible for the operation, on the first day of the session. "We are constantly on the move and have to be able to react to every situation."
"We are not only active in the city center," says the police officer. "We are also on the road in the districts of the city, for example in the areas around the 'Börsenplatz' and 'Schlachte".
"The police are always there when you need them," says the 30-year-old. "But of course you can't be everywhere at once."
For the officer, the carnival season is also a time in which the population is much more in the streets.
"You can see how the city changes," says the police officer. "We always get in touch with the people here at the carnival and

Original English : The head of state also has the right to appoint interim ministers during Senate recesses lasting at least ten days. This is to ensure the government's ability to function. The ministers appointed in this manner must be confirmed by the Senate by the end of the session period to remain in office.

The Republicans secured a majority in the Senate with at least 53 of the 100 seats in the election. However, the Democrats could delay the appointment process in the relevant committees.
Translation Eng->De: This is due to the fact that the Republicans were able to achieve a majority in the committees as well as in the Senate. The Democrats have to do this. The Senate has to confirm the cabinet by the end of the session period.

Original English : There is no question that climate change is intensifying heatwaves in South Asia. Continuous attribution studies that examine the connections between weather phenomena and climate change confirm this. For example, a report by World Weather Attribution found that the likelihood of heatwaves has increased 30-fold since the 19th century. Additionally, an attribution study conducted by the UK's Met Office reveals that the risk of unprecedented heatwaves in India and Pakistan has increased 100-fold due to climate change.
Translation Eng->De: The same study found that heatwaves in the region have become 40% more likely to occur.
There are several factors that increase the risk of heatwaves. First, the increased heat waves in South Asia are caused by global warming. According to the U.K. Met Office, global warming has been increasing the temperature of the Indian subcontinent since the 19th century.
Second, heat waves in South Asia are becoming more frequent. For example, the Met Office found that the frequency of heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased by 50% in the last 20 years.
Third, the increase in heatwave frequency is attributed to climate change. The Met Office attributes the increase to the global warming that causes the temperature of the Indian subcontinent to increase.
Fourth, the increase in heatwave frequency is a result of global warming. The Met Office attributes the increase to global warming, which causes the temperature of the Indian subcontinent to increase.
Fifth, the increase in heatwave frequency is a result of global warming. The Met Office attributes the increase to global warming, which causes the temperature of the Indian subcontinent to increase.
Sixth, the increase in heatwave frequency is a result of climate change.

Original German  : Dass der Klimawandel die Hitzewellen in Südasien verstärkt, steht außer Frage. Immer neue Attributionsstudien, die Zusammenhänge zwischen Wetterphänomenen und dem Klimawandel untersuchen, belegen das. So ergab ein Bericht von World Weather Attribution, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit für Hitzewellen seit dem 19. Jahrhundert 30-fach erhöht ist. Und eine vom britischen Met Office durchgeführte Attributionsstudie zeigt auf, dass die Gefahr beispielloser Hitzewellen in Indien und Pakistan durch den Klimawandel um das Hundertfache gestiegen ist.

Original English : The DSA-110, situated at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) near Bishop, California, is a radio interferometer built for simultaneous FRB discovery and arcsecond-scale localization. The DSA-110 underwent science commissioning and performed observations between February 2022 and March 2024 with a coherent core of 48 4.65-m antennas used for FRB searching combined with 15 outrigger antennas (maximum baseline of 2.5 km) used for localization. Each antenna is equipped with a dual-polarization ambient-temperature 1.28-1.53-GHz receiver. A custom low-noise amplifier design delivering 7 K noise temperature13 was central to achieving sensitivity to 1.9 Jy ms FRBs (for millisecond-duration events). A real-time search for FRBs with 0.262-ms sampling and a dispersion measure (DM) range up to 1,500 pc cm-3 was conducted.
Translation Eng->De: The DSA-110 detected 19 FRBs in the 10-min-long search of the 1-min-long search window, all of which were localized to subarcsecond positions. These data are released as the first FRB catalog from the DSA-100.13

Der DSA-110 durchlief die wissenschaftliche Inbetriebnahme und führte Beobachtungen zwischen Februar 2022 und März 2024 durch. Er nutzte einen kohärenten Kern von 48 Antennen mit 4,65 m Durchmesser für die FRB-Suche sowie 15 Auslegerantennen (maximale Basislinie von 2,5 km) für die Lokalisierung. Jede Antenne ist mit einem dual-polarisierten 1,28–1,53-GHz-Empfänger bei Umgebungstemperatur ausgestattet. Ein speziell entworfener rauscharmer Verstärker, der eine Rauschtemperatur von 7 K liefert, war zentral für die Erreichung der Empfindlichkeit gegenüber FRBs von 1,9 Jy ms (für millisekundendauernde Ereignisse). Eine Echtzeitsuche nach FRBs mit einer Abtastrate von 0,262 ms und einem Dispersionsmaß (DM) von bis zu 1.500 pc cm⁻³ wurde durchgeführt.
Translation De->Eng: Die FRB-Erkennung erfolgte in Echtzeit, wobei die vorläufige Lokalisierungsinformation innerhalb von 0,03 s (0,86 ms) nach dem Eintreffen einer FRB-Signatur bei der Antenne bereit war.

Der DSA-110 ist der erste, der eine FRB-Ereignis- und Lokalisierungsrate von 1000/h über ein Jahr lang aufrechterhalten konnte, mit dem potenziell ein FRB-Datenbank-Datensatz von 5000000 FRBs von 10
